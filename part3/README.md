# Part 3: An Unexpected Party

## About

In [Part 2]() we built, tested and deployed our very own 'Coffee' CRD and
controller. And while that was very exciting, it was only just the beginning.
In this part of the workshop we will look at what it means to use CRDs as an
interface for collaboration between different teams.

We will be extending our Coffee system to include Sugar and Cream CRDs and
controllers. And we will be exploring what it means for each of the CRDs and
controllers to be build and maintained by separate teams of people.

## Learnings and Outcomes

1. An understanding of what it means to build "kubernetes-native" systems
1. An understanding of how to collaborate with other teams/systems on top of
   the kubernetes API via CRDs
