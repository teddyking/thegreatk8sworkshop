# Part 3: An Unexpected Party

## About

In the [previous session](/part2) we built, tested and deployed our very own
CRDs and controllers. And while that was very exciting, it was only just the
beginning. In this part of the workshop we will look at what it means to use
CRDs as an interface for collaboration between different teams.

## Learnings and Outcomes

1. An understanding of what it means to build "kubernetes-native" systems
1. An understanding of how to collaborate with other teams/systems on top of
   the kubernetes API via CRDs
