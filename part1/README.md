# Part 1: More Than Just a Scheduler

## About

Kubernetes is often thought of as a container scheduler, and while it certainly
knows how to schedule a container or two, the _real_ value of kubernetes lies
with its API.

This workshop kicks off with a high-level overview of the features that make
the API so great. Then we'll dive a little deeper into the core components that
comprise the API - namely Resources and Controllers.

There are practical exercises dotted throughout in order to solidify the
concepts and to allow you to get more familiar with talking to the API.

## Learnings and Outcomes

1. An understanding of why the kubernetes API is so good
1. An understanding of how the kubernetes API works
1. How to interact with the kubernetes API via `kubectl`
1. How to interact with the kubernetes API via `client-go`
